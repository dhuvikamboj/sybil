## Advanced Features

### Skill Composing

One skill can call another:

```typescript
 skills: ["base-skill", "advanced-skills"]
```

### Skill Context Injection

When a skill is active, instructions are injected:
```typescript
instructions: `
${SKILL_MD_PATH}
${WORKING_MEMORY}
---
You have access to these skills: ${skills}
`;
```

### Conditional Logic

```typescript
if (userContext.userType === "premium") {
  skills.push("advanced-skills", "priority-support");
}
```

### Skills with Tools

Skills can specify tool dependencies:

```typescript
tools: ["browser-tools", "whatsapp-tools"];
```

---

## Skill Performance Tracking

### Metrics Collected
- Usage frequency per skill
- Success rate per task
- User satisfaction ratings
- Time saved per usage

### Auto-Improvement

Based on metrics:
- ✅ Underutilized skills → archived
- ✅ High-failure skills → flagged for review
- ✅ Often-requested functionality → automatically creates new skills
- ✅ Low-rated skills → offers improvements or alternatives

## Debugging Skills

### Skill Not Working

```typescript
// Check skill file
# Open: skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
# Verify: Frontmatter is correct
# Verify: Instructions are clear

Common issues:
- Missing fields in frontmatter
- Invalid YAML syntax
- Missing required sections
- Conflicting examples
```

### Tool Not Available in Skill

```typescript
// Check tool imports
// Include tools in skills directory

"tools": {
  "browser-tools": /* tools object */
}
```

### Activation Issues

```typescript
// Check skill activation
User: /list-skills
→ Verify skill is active

// Force activate specific skill
User: /activate-skill my-skill
→ Skill should load directly
```
